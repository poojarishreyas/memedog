    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>hlo I am Mr. dogayes. I am a meme dog. i waas brought up in internet and graduated from insta universaity. became popular in 2013. The meme consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog, accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English. The meme most frequently uses an image of a Shiba Inu named Kabosu, though versions with other Shiba Inus are also popular.[2]

        The meme is based on a 2010 photograph of Kabosu which became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year. The Shiba Inu had a notable presence in popular culture in late 2013, including a cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, launching in December of that year. Several online polls and media outlets recognized Doge as one of the best Internet memes of the 2010s. <img src="Screenshot 2024-03-23 172531.png" alt=""> </p>
